### 2022-2 AI SE NUGU FRESH Project

### ðŸ’¥ Introduction

Fresh product delivery services have continued to increase as non-face-to-face delivery services have exploded since the COVID-19 incident. These services are very popular not only among people in their 20s and 30s who are familiar with electronic devices, but also among middle-aged people between the ages of 50s and 60s. According to a news article by ITWORLD, only 52% of middle-aged people had experience using fresh product delivery services in 2021, but about 88.6% used fresh product delivery in 2022, and nearly half of them frequently used the service. More and more people are using fresh product delivery services, but there was no platform to compare the delivery prices of fresh products sold by companies. <br><br>

In view of this inconvenience, we tried to provide a service that tells price comparison information with an easiest  accessible equipment which is NUGU speaker and sends the requested information to the mobile phone via SMS.
