### 2022-2 AI SE NUGU FRESH Project <br>

### ðŸ’¥ Introduction <br>

Fresh product delivery services have continued to increase as non-face-to-face delivery services have exploded since the COVID-19 incident. These services are very popular not only among people in their 20s and 30s who are familiar with electronic devices, but also among middle-aged people between the ages of 50s and 60s. According to a news article by ITWORLD, only 52% of middle-aged people had experience using fresh product delivery services in 2021, but about 88.6% used fresh product delivery in 2022, and nearly half of them frequently used the service. More and more people are using fresh product delivery services, but there was no platform to compare the delivery prices of fresh products sold by companies. <br><br>

In view of this inconvenience, we tried to create a service that provides price comparison information through NUGU speakers and mobile phone SMS, which are the most eaisest to access. As a price comparison brand, representative brands of the three fresh product delivery companies (Coupang Gomgom, Market Kurly KF365, SSG FRESH), which account for approximately 90% of Korea, were selected. In addition, we tried to compare the average prices of marts and markets provided by KAMIS. Fresh products included in the top 30 foods with high domestic consumption were selected by the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety as the targets for the service products provided. In addition to comparing prices, the average prices of marts and markets provided by KAMIS are predicted, so that consumers can easily determine when to purchase and make more economical consumption possible. <br><br>
